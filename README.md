The reposition collects the assignments for the online course R Programming taught by John Hopkins University via Coursera platform.


About Coursera:

Coursera is an online learning platform founded by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers courses, specializations, and degrees. Coursera works with universities and other organizations to offer online courses, specializations, and degrees in a variety of subjects, such as engineering, humanities, medicine, biology, social sciences, mathematics, business, computer science, digital marketing, data science, and others (Wikipedia: Coursera). 


About R:

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R can be considered as a different implementation of S, and a very common language for data science applications. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 


About Course:

This is the second course in the Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University and it focuses on the nuts and bolts of using R as a programming language. The course consists of 4-week workload. Instructors are biostatistics professors at John Hopkins University: Dr. Roger Peng, Dr. Jeff Leak and Dr. Brian Caffo. 

In this course studnets learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis: how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis provide working examples.
